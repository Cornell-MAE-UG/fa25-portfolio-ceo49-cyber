## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a Undergraduate Mechanical Engineer at Cornell University. 

My prior experience includes working a summer internship at Amazon where I employed my knowledge from from Statics, Materials, and Mechatronics to design a remote monitoring system for the conveyor belts in Amazon warehouses.

I hope to one day work in the field of sustainable development.
